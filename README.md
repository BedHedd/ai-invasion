# ai-invasion
exploring making a local novel ai story writer

# background
DougDoug makes interesting and entertaining videos, a series I like is his AI invasion Series with twitch chat.
For reference here is [a playlist of the series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzY2D6XUB8KfzQbQBRV2KVxrRJ3kO1Bwo&si=uh6k-siNpcEZMxbi)
To make the series possible, he uses [NovelAI](https://novelai.net). I wanted to make an app that you can run locally so that you can switch out models and not worry about updates.

These are some experiments and prompts I made with chatgpt

# building this project
To run the exploration notebook, make sure to install pythoon and ollama. When building your environment, make sure to install the dependencies (ollama, openai, etc) from the [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) file
