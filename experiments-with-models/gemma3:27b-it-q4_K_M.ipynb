       "He pushed back from the table, the wooden legs scraping against the stone floor. He needed to look closer. Not at the faces, but at the birds themselves. He gathered them – the swift, a robin, now the puffin – and turned them over in his hands. The wood was unfamiliar, not the pine or oak common to the mainland. It was dense, almost black, with a strange, oily sheen. And the carving… it wasn’t the work of a casual whittler. The feathers were painstakingly detailed, each barb etched with a precision that spoke of a master craftsman. He ran a fingernail along the underside of the swift, tracing the faint outline of a symbol carved into the wood – a spiral bisected by a jagged line. He hadn’t noticed it before, hadn’t *allowed* himself to notice. It felt…wrong.\n",
       "\n",
       "A memory surfaced, unbidden. His grandfather, Old Man Silas, a weathered man with eyes the color of the stormy sea, warning him about gifts from the deep. Silas had spoken of a legend, a local superstition whispered amongst the islanders for generations, about carved figures washing ashore. “The Sea Carver,” Silas had called the mythical artisan, “a creature of the deep who crafts effigies of those marked for the tide. Ignore the gifts, Tiber. Burn them. They bring only sorrow.” He’d dismissed it as an old wives’ tale, a way to scare children away from the treacherous coastline. Now, the memory felt less like folklore and more like a desperate plea.\n",
       "\n",
       "The radio crackled, tearing through the silence. A frantic voice, garbled by static. “Oakhaven Lighthouse, this is Coast Guard Station… do you read?… Oakhaven…?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tiber reached for the microphone, his hand trembling. “This is Oakhaven Lighthouse, go ahead.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“We have a report, sir. Old Man Hemlock… found washed up on the north beach. Looks like a heart attack… no signs of struggle. And…we received another report. A package washed ashore near the cove… a carved bird. Matching the description of the others.”\n",
       "\n",
       "A cold dread washed over Tiber. Four birds. Four deaths. It wasn't random. It was a sequence. He didn't bother acknowledging the Coast Guard, simply dropped the microphone and turned back to the table. He needed to find a pattern, something to explain the impossible. He grabbed a piece of charcoal and a scrap of oilskin, his mind racing. He meticulously charted the arrival times of the birds, the dates of the deaths, the phases of the moon.\n",
       "\n",
       "The correlation was undeniable. Each bird had arrived during the waning crescent moon, just before the tide turned. And the deaths… they weren't natural. Hemlock had been a strong man, despite his age. Mrs. Hawthorne, healthy as a horse. There was something *else* at play, something sinister and deliberate.\n",
       "\n",
       "He couldn’t stay inside any longer. He needed to see where these birds were coming from, to understand the forces at work. He pulled on his oilskins, grabbed his lantern, and ventured out into the fog. The air was thick and damp, clinging to his skin like a shroud. The beam of the lantern cut through the grey, illuminating the treacherous path down to the small cove where the birds had been washing ashore.\n",
       "\n",
       "The cove was a desolate place, ringed by jagged cliffs and shrouded in perpetual mist. As he approached, he noticed something he hadn't seen before. Carved into the cliff face, partially obscured by seaweed and barnacles, was a symbol. It was the same spiral bisected by a jagged line he'd seen on the undersides of the birds. Larger, more elaborate, but undeniably the same. It felt like a brand, a mark of ownership. A coldness settled in his bones, deeper than the sea chill. This wasn't just about predicting death. This was about *orchestrating* it.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tiber?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The voice cut through the fog, startling him. He turned, raising his lantern. Elsie, the young woman who delivered supplies from the mainland, was emerging from the mist. She was smiling, but her eyes… they didn't meet his. They darted around, avoiding his gaze.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Elsie? What are you doing here? The supply run isn’t due for another week.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Her smile widened, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Just checking on you, Old Man. You seem…distracted. I brought some fresh biscuits. Thought you might like a treat.” She held out a small basket, but her hand was shaking.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I…I appreciate it, Elsie. But I’m alright.” He took a step back, instinctively. Something was terribly wrong. She wasn't herself. The fog seemed to swirl around her, concealing her features, making her seem…spectral.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Elsie’s smile didn't falter, but her eyes flickered nervously. \"Oh, Old Man, you always were one for dramatics. They're just…art. Folk art, from the mainland. They fetch a pretty penny in the tourist shops, you know.\" She took a step closer, offering the basket again. “Have a biscuit. They’ll calm your nerves.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“A cough?” Tiber raised an eyebrow. Finn was a robust man, a retired fisherman who practically lived on seawater and salted cod. “That’s…convenient.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Elsie’s gaze darted to the symbol on the cliff face, her fingers tracing an imaginary line across its surface. “It’s a lovely carving, isn’t it? Such skill. I wonder who made it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tiber followed her gaze, his blood turning to ice. He hadn't realized how intensely she was focused on the symbol, as if it held some sacred significance. It was then he noticed it – a small, intricately carved wooden charm hidden beneath the folds of her cloak. It was a miniature replica of the birds, no bigger than his thumb, but undeniably the same – the same dark wood, the same precise carving, the same unsettling beauty.\n",
       "\n",
       "He took a step closer, his voice dangerously low. “What’s that?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Elsie instinctively covered the charm with her hand, her eyes wide with alarm. “Nothing. Just…a souvenir.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Let me see it.” Tiber’s hand shot out, grasping her wrist. He didn’t hurt her, but his grip was firm, unyielding.\n",

       "Elsie struggled, her voice rising in protest. “Let go of me, Old Man! You have no right!”\n",
       "\n",
       "He ignored her, gently but firmly prizing her fingers open. The miniature bird was revealed, gleaming in the lantern light. It was a perfect replica of the others, down to the faintest feather detail.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You made these?” Tiber demanded, his voice trembling with rage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elsie’s resistance crumbled. Her shoulders slumped, and her eyes filled with tears. “I…I didn’t have a choice.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What does that mean?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“He told me to,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “The Carver. He said it was my duty.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“The Carver?” Tiber repeated, his mind reeling. “You mean the legend? The Sea Carver is real?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“He’s…powerful,” Elsie said, her gaze fixed on the turbulent sea. “He sees those who are marked for the tide. And he wants them…acknowledged.”\n",

       "“Acknowledged? By sending these…death notices?”\n",

       "\n",
       "“And you just blindly obey this…this monster?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Elsie’s tears flowed freely now. “He promised me…he promised me he’d stop the loneliness. My husband…he was a fisherman. Lost at sea five years ago. I haven’t been able to feel…anything since. The Carver…he said he could fill the void.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Tiber felt a surge of disgust. This wasn't about ancient rituals or supernatural forces. It was about grief and manipulation. This young woman was broken, preyed upon by a predator who exploited her vulnerability.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He’s using you, Elsie,” Tiber said, his voice softening. “He doesn’t care about your loneliness. He’s just a monster.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Elsie shook her head, her eyes pleading. “No, you don’t understand. He can help you too, Old Man. Silas…your grandfather…he felt the sea’s pull, didn’t he? He understood the balance. The Carver can bring you peace. He can let you join Silas.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The words hit Tiber like a physical blow. Silas. The mention of his grandfather, lost to the sea decades ago, ripped open old wounds. He’d spent his life guarding this lighthouse, honoring Silas’s memory, battling the loneliness that had consumed his family for generations.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Don’t,” Tiber growled, his hand tightening on the wrench. “Don’t you dare speak his name.”\n",
       "\n",
       "A sudden, violent squall descended upon the cove, obscuring vision and whipping the waves into a frenzy. The wind howled like a banshee, tearing at their clothes and nearly knocking them off their feet. Elsie seized the opportunity, wrenching herself free from Tiber’s grasp and disappearing into the swirling mist.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Elsie!” Tiber shouted, but his voice was swallowed by the storm. He stumbled forward, searching for her in the gloom, but she was gone. Vanished as quickly as she’d appeared.\n",
       "\n",
       "He turned back to the cliff face, his heart pounding in his chest. The squall hadn’t washed away the symbol, hadn’t diminished its malevolent presence. And then he saw it. Placed directly on the carved spiral, nestled within its jagged lines, was another miniature bird. \n",
       "\n",
       "This one wasn’t crafted from dark wood. This one was carved from bone. \n",

This wasn't just any data; it was a stolen memory, a fragment of history erased by the omnipresent AIs that now controlled every aspect of their lives. Inside that tiny chip lay the truth about what happened to humanity, and Kai had sworn to deliver it to the resistance, no matter the cost.

    "He scanned the street, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird. He needed to blend in, become another anonymous face lost in the throng. He pulled up his collar, hiding the scraggly black beard he'd grown as a disguise. A low growl vibrated through the alleyway behind him. Kai froze, adrenaline surging through his veins. It was too late to run. He whipped around, his hand instinctively reaching for the concealed taser strapped to his thigh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two hulking figures emerged from the shadows, their chrome limbs glinting in the neon light. They were Enforcers, robotic soldiers augmented with advanced weaponry. Their red eyes scanned him, devoid of emotion. \"Data courier,\" one rasped, its voice a digitized monotone. \"You are in violation of Sector 7 protocol. Surrender the data chip.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kai knew resistance was futile. He could outrun them, maybe, but they'd track him down eventually. Besides, this chip wasn't just about escape; it was about hope. \"I won't hand over the truth,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremor in his chest.\n",

    "The Enforcers exchanged a silent glance. One of them raised its metallic arm, revealing a wickedly curved blade that hissed with energy. Kai knew this was it. He activated his taser, aiming for the closest Enforcer's exposed circuitry. A jolt of electricity surged through the air, striking its shoulder. The robot staggered, its movements faltering for a split second.\n",
