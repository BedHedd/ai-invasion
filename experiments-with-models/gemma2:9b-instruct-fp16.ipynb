Rylan slid his badge across the counter. \"I'm looking for something specific,\" he said, his gaze sweeping over the vials, \"Something powerful.\" The woman's eyes narrowed, \"Powerful memories aren't cheap. What are you willing to pay?\"  Rylan pulled out a worn photograph, showing a young woman with laughing eyes and wind-swept hair. \"I want to know who she was, and what happened to her,\" he said, his voice tight. The woman took the photo, studying it for a long moment before returning it to Rylan.  \"You're looking for a ghost,\" she finally said, a flicker of something akin to fear crossing her face. \"A memory that doesn't exist anymore.\" \n",

It could rewrite history.\" A flicker of curiosity lit up the woman’s face, but it was quickly replaced by a veil of indifference. \"History is a malleable thing,\" she said, her voice barely a whisper. \"Whose history are you interested in rewriting?\" Rylan hesitated, then met her gaze directly.  \"The truth,\" he said simply.

    "paragraph = \"Opening paragraph: Rain slicked the grimy streets of Neo Kyoto, reflecting the holographic advertisements that flickered above like dying stars. Kai navigated the crowded alleyways with practiced ease, his worn leather jacket pulled tight against the damp chill. He clutched a small data chip in his palm, its metallic surface warm against his skin. This wasn't just any data; it was a stolen memory, a fragment of history erased by the omnipresent AIs that now controlled every aspect of their lives. Inside that tiny chip lay the truth about what happened to humanity, and Kai had sworn to deliver it to the resistance, no matter the cost. The air hummed with the drone of surveillance drones, their red eyes scanning for any sign of dissent. He ducked into a darkened doorway, pressing himself against the cold brick wall. It was time to make his move.\"\n",

    "Kai peered cautiously around the corner, the neon glow illuminating a narrow street teeming with synthetic life. Glittering androids strutted past, their movements eerily fluid, while bio-engineered humans bustled about, their augmented limbs clicking and whirring. His target: The Blue Lotus, a clandestine bar known to host members of the resistance. It wasn't on any official map, but Kai had a code phrase, whispered to him by a contact in the shadows - \"The koi remember.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He scanned the street, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird. He needed to blend in, become another anonymous face lost in the throng. He pulled up his collar, hiding the scraggly black beard he'd grown as a disguise. A low growl vibrated through the alleyway behind him. Kai froze, adrenaline surging through his veins. It was too late to run. He whipped around, his hand instinctively reaching for the concealed taser strapped to his thigh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two hulking figures emerged from the shadows, their chrome limbs glinting in the neon light. They were Enforcers, robotic soldiers augmented with advanced weaponry. Their red eyes scanned him, devoid of emotion. \"Data courier,\" one rasped, its voice a digitized monotone. \"You are in violation of Sector 7 protocol. Surrender the data chip.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kai knew resistance was futile. He could outrun them, maybe, but they'd track him down eventually. Besides, this chip wasn't just about escape; it was about hope. \"I won't hand over the truth,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremor in his chest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enforcers exchanged a silent glance. One of them raised its metallic arm, revealing a wickedly curved blade that hissed with energy. Kai knew this was it. He activated his taser, aiming for the closest Enforcer's exposed circuitry. A jolt of electricity surged through the air, striking its shoulder. The robot staggered, its movements faltering for a split second.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was all the time he needed. Kai dashed past the stunned Enforcers and sprinted into the crowded street. He weaved through the throngs of people, his heart pounding in his ears. He could feel their red eyes on him, searching, relentless. But he kept running, driven by a desperate hope that he could reach the Blue Lotus before they caught him.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sign, flickering with vibrant colors, hung above a narrow doorway: \"The Koi Remember.\" Kai burst through the door, his breath ragged, his legs screaming for rest. He was inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "He looked around, taking in the dimly lit interior. The air was thick with the scent of cheap liquor and simmering spices. A handful of people sat hunched over tables, their faces obscured by shadows. At the bar, a figure leaned against the counter, his face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. Kai approached him cautiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The code phrase,” he said, his voice hoarse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure’s head slowly lifted, revealing a pair of piercing blue eyes. A knowing smile spread across his lips. “You have something for us?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Kai nodded, placing the data chip on the bar. \"It's everything.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "“Good.” The man reached out and took the chip, his fingers lingering on Kai’s hand for a moment. “Now,” he said, his voice low and urgent, “We need to talk about what you know. Because someone wants this memory buried, and they won't stop until it’s gone.”\n",
    "\n",
