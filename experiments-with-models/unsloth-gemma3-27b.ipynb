       "The birds intensified their dance, the loops tightening, converging over a stretch of coastline Tiber hadn’t visited in decades: Widow’s Cove. The name itself tasted like ash in his mouth. He’d avoided the place since… since Alistair. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to recall the last time he’d seen his brother, but the memory was stubbornly fractured, like looking at a reflection shattered into a thousand pieces. He saw flashes—Alistair laughing, mending nets, the glint of sunlight on the waves—but the edges blurred, replaced by an unnerving static. \n",
       "\n",
       "He hadn’t been a strong swimmer, Alistair. Not like Tiber, who’d practically grown up in the water. Alistair preferred the land, the feel of the earth under his boots. And there had been the boat. A small fishing skiff, patched and weathered, the *Sea Swallow*. They'd argued about it, the night before Alistair went missing. Tiber had warned him about a brewing storm, a vicious Nor’easter rolling in from Greenland. Alistair had insisted he needed to check the lobster pots, a late-season haul that could mean a good winter for them both. He hadn’t listened. \n",
       "\n",
       "Tiber shook his head, trying to dislodge the fragmented memory. It felt…wrong. Not the facts, necessarily, but the *feeling* surrounding it. There was a coldness to it now, an emptiness that hadn’t been there before. He hadn’t remembered feeling *this* detached, this…unconcerned. He’d grieved, of course. For years. But this wasn’t grief. It was something else. Something akin to…fear.\n",
       "\n",
       "He grabbed his oilskins and a heavy walking stick, the familiar weight grounding him. Widow’s Cove was a good hour’s trek, a winding path through gorse and heather. The wind whipped around him, carrying the scent of salt and decaying seaweed.  As he neared the cove, he noticed something was different. He’d remembered the beach as being broad and sandy, a sheltered crescent perfect for hauling in nets. Now, the sand was gone, replaced by a jagged jumble of black rocks, thrust up by some unseen force. The cliffs seemed to loom higher, their faces scarred with new fissures. \n",
       "\n",
       "The terns circled relentlessly above the cove, their cries echoing off the cliffs. He scanned the rocks, his gaze snagging on something half-buried in the sand. He knelt, bracing himself against the wind, and began to dig. It was a stone, roughly shaped and weathered by the sea. About the size of his hand, it bore a carving—a spiral enclosed within a circle, bisected by a jagged line. \n",
       "\n",
       "He recognized the symbol. Old Morag, the island’s herbalist and keeper of forgotten lore, had shown him similar carvings in an ancient book she kept hidden away in her cottage. It was a symbol connected to the *Dùch*, the ancient spirits of the sea. And specifically, to the offerings made to appease them—sacrifices, she'd called them, though she'd quickly clamped shut the book when he'd pressed for details. \n",
       "\n",
       "“You shouldn’t be here, Tiber,” a voice rasped, startling him. \n",
       "\n",
       "He turned to see Morag standing a few feet away, her face etched with disapproval. She was a woman carved from the same granite as the island itself, her eyes the grey of a storm-tossed sea. \n",
       "\n",
       "“Morag,” he said, his voice tight. “What is this place? What does this stone mean?”\n",
       "\n",
       "She didn’t answer immediately, her gaze sweeping over the cove as if assessing the damage. “This is a place of forgetting, Tiber. A place best left undisturbed. The sea remembers, but it doesn’t *share*. Some things are better left buried.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“These birds…” he gestured towards the swirling mass above. “They’re trying to tell me something. About Alistair.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Morag’s lips thinned. “The birds are messengers, aye. But they don’t always speak the truth. Or, more accurately, they speak a truth you may not be ready to hear.” She took a step closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. “There are powers at play here, Tiber. Ancient powers. And they don’t take kindly to prying eyes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What powers?” he demanded, his grip tightening on his walking stick. \n",
       "\n",
       "Morag hesitated, her gaze darting around the cove as if expecting to be overheard. “Let’s just say…the sea demands its due. And sometimes, the price is higher than we can afford.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I’m not afraid,” Tiber said, though a shiver ran down his spine.\n",
       "\n",
       "Morag’s gaze hardened. “You should be. Leave this place, Tiber. Forget what you’ve seen. For your own sake.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He shook his head, his gaze fixed on the carved stone in his hand. \"I can't. Not anymore.\"  He had to know what happened to Alistair. The terns, the stone, the cove… it was all connected. He felt it in his bones. \n",
       "\n",
       "Morag sighed, a sound like the wind whistling through a graveyard. \"Then you walk a dangerous path, old man. A path from which there may be no return.” She turned and began to walk away, her figure disappearing into the mist. \n",
       "\n",
       "Tiber remained kneeling, tracing the jagged line on the stone with his thumb. The terns continued to circle, their cries growing more frantic. He looked out at the grey, churning sea, a sudden wave of unease washing over him.  He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd awakened something long dormant, something that didn’t want to be disturbed. And he knew, with a chilling certainty, that whatever it was, it was now watching him.\n",

Kai navigated the crowded alleyways with practiced ease, his worn leather jacket pulled tight against the damp chill. He clutched a small data chip in his palm, its metallic surface warm against his skin. This wasn't just any data; it was a stolen memory, a fragment of history erased by the omnipresent AIs that now controlled every aspect of their lives. Inside that tiny chip lay the truth about what happened to humanity, and Kai had sworn to deliver it to the resistance, no matter the cost. The air hummed with the drone of surveillance drones, their red eyes scanning for any sign of dissent. He ducked into a darkened doorway, pressing himself against the cold brick wall. It was time to make his move.\"\n",

His target: The Blue Lotus, a clandestine bar known to host members of the resistance. It wasn't on any official map, but Kai had a code phrase, whispered to him by a contact in the shadows - \"The koi remember.\"\n",

    "He scanned the street, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird. He needed to blend in, become another anonymous face lost in the throng. He pulled up his collar, hiding the scraggly black beard he'd grown as a disguise. A low growl vibrated through the alleyway behind him. Kai froze, adrenaline surging through his veins. It was too late to run. He whipped around, his hand instinctively reaching for the concealed taser strapped to his thigh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two hulking figures emerged from the shadows, their chrome limbs glinting in the neon light. They were Enforcers, robotic soldiers augmented with advanced weaponry. Their red eyes scanned him, devoid of emotion. \"Data courier,\" one rasped, its voice a digitized monotone. \"You are in violation of Sector 7 protocol. Surrender the data chip.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kai knew resistance was futile. He could outrun them, maybe, but they'd track him down eventually. Besides, this chip wasn't just about escape; it was about hope. \"I won't hand over the truth,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremor in his chest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enforcers exchanged a silent glance. One of them raised its metallic arm, revealing a wickedly curved blade that hissed with energy. Kai knew this was it. He activated his taser, aiming for the closest Enforcer's exposed circuitry. A jolt of electricity surged through the air, striking its shoulder. The robot staggered, its movements faltering for a split second.\n",

    "It was all the time he needed. Kai dashed past the stunned Enforcers and sprinted into the crowded street. He weaved through the throngs of people, his heart pounding in his ears.

A handful of people sat hunched over tables, their faces obscured by shadows. At the bar, a figure leaned against the counter, his face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. Kai approached him cautiously.\n",

    "\n",
    "“Good.” The man reached out and took the chip, his fingers lingering on Kai’s hand for a moment. “Now,” he said, his voice low and urgent, “We need to talk about what you know. Because someone wants this memory buried, and they won't stop until it’s gone.”\n",
